As of version 0.14, Shiny has built-in support for displaying modal dialogs like the one below:

You can see the app in action [here](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/114-modal-dialog/).

For the majority of use cases, there are three parts for displaying a modal dialog:

* The HTML for the modal dialog.
* A call to `showModal()`, which sends the HTML to the client to be displayed.
* An observer that performs the two steps above in response to some event.

This simple app illustrates how these things fit together:

````r
shinyApp(
  ui = basicPage(
    actionButton("show", "Show modal dialog")
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    observeEvent(input$show, {
      showModal(modalDialog(
        title = "Important message",
        "This is an important message!",
        easyClose = TRUE
      ))
    })
  }
)
````


The call to `modalDialog()` generates the HTML. If you simply run `modalDialog()` at the R console, it will print out the HTML for a modal dialog.

The call to `showModal()` sends the HTML to the client browser to be displayed.

Finally, there is `observeEvent()`. When `input$show` changes (in other words, when the button is pressed), it runs the `showModal(modalDialog())` code.


## Options

There are a few options that control the appearance an behavior of `modalDialog()`:

* `title`: An optional title for the modal dialog.
* `size`: Controls the width of the modal dialog. Can be `"s"` for small, `"m"` for medium (the default), or `"l"` for large.
* `footer`: Content to display in an optional footer for the modal dialog. The default is to display a button that dismisses the modal dialog.
* `easyClose`: If `TRUE`, then clicking outside the modal dialog or pressing Esc will close the dialog. If `FALSE` (the default), then the user will have to click on the Dismiss button to close it.
