The `shinyjs` package lets you perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny apps that will greatly improve your apps without having to know any JavaScript.

Examples include: hiding an element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value, delaying code execution by a few seconds, and many more useful functions for both the end user and the developer. shinyjs can also be used to easily call your own custom JavaScript functions from R.

This [demo app](http://deanattali.com/shinyjs/overview#demo) lets you play around with some of the functionality in `shinyjs`.

You can find out more about `shinyjs` on the [package website](http://deanattali.com/shinyjs/) and in the [package repo](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/blob/master/README.md).
