The current Dublin Bus (Ireland) website and app will only allow you to view information for a single bus stop. This frustrated me into creating this Shiny app.

I can commute home using a number of different bus stops. This Shiny app will collate the information on a number of different bus stops and filter out the relevant buses for the user.
The search query string in the URL can be used to pre-populate the bus stop numbers and buses selected.
