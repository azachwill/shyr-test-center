An interactive local area health and wellbeing profiling tool for Scotland.  The app provides users with an assortment of custom interactive visualisations, allowing exploration of temporal and geographical comparisons across a range of indicators of health and wider determinants of health.
  
This app is one of the runners up of the 2019 Shiny Contest. The app was created to help people living and working in Scotland explore how geographical areas have changed over time or how they compare to other areas, across a range of indicators of health and wider determinants of health. The app is pretty complicated, but no more than it has to be with such a sprawling dataset behind it. Each part of the app has a carefully curated set of options that expose lots of power without being totally overwhelming. The context-sensitive Definition button and pervasive Download data/Save chart options are nice touches as well.
