The New Zealand Trade Intelligence Dashboard provides up-to-date annual information on trade by commodities, services and trading partners. It presents a full picture of New Zealand?s trading profile through intuitive and interactive graphs and tables. It also provides powerful functionality enabling users to generate their own reports for different commodities, and markets or groups of markets that interest them. All figures, tables and data are downloadable. It works on both PCs and mobile devices.

The philosophy of user-centered design is executed throughout the entire UI and functionality design of the shiny app. There will be less than three clicks away for almost any of users needs.

The shiny app has the potential to be easily adapted to generate trade intelligence for other countries.
