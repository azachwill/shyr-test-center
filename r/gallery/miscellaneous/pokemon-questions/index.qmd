This is a fun, simple app around 20 Questions, but instead of random objects, it is Pokemon. Select any one up until generation 6 and go through the questions 1 by 1 until it tries to guess the Pokemon you are thinking of. For certain details that are relevant to the quiz that might not be aware of, there is a reference table included.
