A Shiny app for tracking tweets around conferences and events. With a leader board and tools for exploring tweets sent with a conference hashtag, users can stay up to date with the online conversation, or explore the action after the fact.
  
This app is one of the runners up of the 2019 Shiny Contest. We have fond memories of rstudio::conf 2019, but nostalgia isn't the only thing going for this dashboard by Garrick Aden-Buie. There are a lot of great tweets we missed the first time around, and we added some new follows. We also loved the Top Emoji plot.
