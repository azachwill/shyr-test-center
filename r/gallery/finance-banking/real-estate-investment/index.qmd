Intelligentsia's aim is to provide residential real estate investors with a home value appreciation forecast for neighborhoods within New York City. Our solution ranks NYC census tracts by likelihood of gentrification. A plethora of data were acquired and analyzed to create the Intelligentsia model. Among those data sets are ACS/Census data, Google Search Trends, Yelp ratings, NYC TLC taxicab trips, NYC Subway network and stations, residentsâ€™ travel time to work and various datasets from NYC Open Data.
