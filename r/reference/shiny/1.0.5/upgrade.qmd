## Full changelog

### Bug fixes

* Fixed [#1818](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/1818): `conditionalPanel()` expressions that have a newline character in them caused the application to not work. ([#1820](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/pull/1820))

* Added a safe wrapper function for internal calls to `jsonlite::fromJSON()`. ([#1822](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/pull/1822))
