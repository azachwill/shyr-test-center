title: Upgrade notes for Shiny 0.12.1
---

* Fixed an issue where unbindAll() causes subsequent bindAll() to be ignored for previously bound outputs. (#856)

* Undeprecate `dataTableOutput` and `renderDataTable`, which had been deprecated in favor of the new DT package. The DT package is a bit too new and has a slightly different API, we were too hasty in deprecating the existing Shiny functions.
