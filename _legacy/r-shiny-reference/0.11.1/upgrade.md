* Major client-side performance improvements for pages that have many conditionalPanels, tabPanels, and plotOutputs. (#693, #717, #723)

* `tabPanel`s now use the `title` for `value` by default. This fixes a bug in which an icon in the title caused problems with a conditionalPanel's test condition. (#725, #728)

* `selectInput` now has a `size` argument to control the height of the input box. (#729)

* `navbarPage` no longer includes a first row of extra whitespace when `header=NULL`. (#722)

* `selectInput`s now use Bootstrap styling when `selectize=FALSE`. (#724)

* Better vertical spacing of label for checkbox groups and radio buttons.

* `selectInput` correctly uses width for both selectize and non-selectize inputs. (#702)

* The wrapper tag generated by `htmlOutput` and `uiOutput` can now be any type of HTML tag, instead of just span and div. Also, custom classes are now allowed on the tag. (#704)

* Slider problems in IE 11 and Chrome on touchscreen-equipped Windows computers have been fixed. (#700)

* Sliders now work correctly with draggable panels. (#711)

* Fixed arguments in `fixedPanel`. (#709)

* downloadHandler content callback functions are now invoked with a temp file name that has the same extension as the final filename that will be used by the download. This is to deal with the fact that some file writing functions in R will auto-append the extension for their file type (pdf, zip).
