  <p>An observer reference class object. This object has the following

response to invalidations. If the observer was invalidated prior to
this call but it has not re-executed yet then that re-execution will
still occur, because the flush is already scheduled.</p></dd>

invalidations. If the observer was invalidated while suspended, then it
will schedule itself for re-execution.</p></dd>

scheduled for re-execution.</p></dd>
<dt><code>setPriority(priority = 0)</code></dt><dd><p>Change this observer's priority. Note that if the observer is currently
invalidated, then the change in priority will not take effect until the

which case the priority change will be effective upon resume.</p></dd>
<dt><code>setAutoDestroy(autoDestroy)</code></dt><dd><p>Sets whether this observer should be automatically destroyed when its

ended, then destroy() is called immediately."</p></dd>

No arguments will be provided to the callback function when it is
invoked.</p></dd>

  <h3 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h3>

  <p>An observer is like a reactive expression in that it can read reactive values
and call reactive expressions, and will automatically re-execute when those
dependencies change. But unlike reactive expressions, it doesn't yield a
result and can't be used as an input to other reactive expressions. Thus,
observers are only useful for their side effects (for example, performing
I/O).</p>
<p>Another contrast between reactive expressions and observers is their
execution strategy. Reactive expressions use lazy evaluation; that is, when
their dependencies change, they don't re-execute right away but rather wait
until they are called by someone else. Indeed, if they are not called then
they will never re-execute. In contrast, observers use eager evaluation; as
soon as their dependencies change, they schedule themselves to re-execute.</p>
<p>Starting with Shiny 0.10.0, observers are automatically destroyed by default
when the <a href='domains.html'>domain</a> that owns them ends (e.g. when a Shiny
session ends).</p>
