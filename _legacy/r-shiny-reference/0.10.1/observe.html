<h3 data-swiftype-index="false">Arguments</h3>
<table class="arguments">
  <tr>
    <th>x</th>
    <td>An expression (quoted or unquoted). Any return value will be
ignored.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>env</th>
    <td>The parent environment for the reactive expression. By default,
this is the calling environment, the same as when defining an ordinary
non-reactive expression.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>quoted</th>
    <td>Is the expression quoted? By default, this is <code>FALSE</code>.
This is useful when you want to use an expression that is stored in a
variable; to do so, it must be quoted with `quote()`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>label</th>
    <td>A label for the observer, useful for debugging.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>suspended</th>
    <td>If <code>TRUE</code>, start the observer in a suspended state.
If <code>FALSE</code> (the default), start in a non-suspended state.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>priority</th>
    <td>An integer or numeric that controls the priority with which
this observer should be executed. An observer with a given priority level
will always execute sooner than all observers with a lower priority level.
Positive, negative, and zero values are allowed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>domain</th>
    <td>See <a href='domains.html'>domains</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>autoDestroy</th>
    <td>If <code>TRUE</code> (the default), the observer will be
automatically destroyed when its domain (if any) ends.</td>
  </tr>

  <p>An observer reference class object. This object has the following
  methods:
  <dl>
<dt><code>suspend()</code></dt><dd>
      Causes this observer to stop scheduling flushes (re-executions) in
      response to invalidations. If the observer was invalidated prior to
      this call but it has not re-executed yet then that re-execution will
      still occur, because the flush is already scheduled.
    </dd>
<dt><code>resume()</code></dt><dd>
      Causes this observer to start re-executing in response to
      invalidations. If the observer was invalidated while suspended, then it
      will schedule itself for re-execution.
    </dd>
<dt><code>destroy()</code></dt><dd>
      Stops the observer from executing ever again, even if it is currently
      scheduled for re-execution.
    </dd>
<dt><code>setPriority(priority = 0)</code></dt><dd>
      Change this observer's priority. Note that if the observer is currently
      invalidated, then the change in priority will not take effect until the
      next invalidation--unless the observer is also currently suspended, in
      which case the priority change will be effective upon resume.
    </dd>
<dt><code>setAutoDestroy(autoDestroy)</code></dt><dd>
      Sets whether this observer should be automatically destroyed when its
      domain (if any) ends. If autoDestroy is TRUE and the domain already
      ended, then destroy() is called immediately."
    </dd>
<dt><code>onInvalidate(callback)</code></dt><dd>
      Register a callback function to run when this observer is invalidated.
      No arguments will be provided to the callback function when it is
      invoked.
    </dd>

<div data-section="Description">

  <p>Creates an observer from the given expression.</p>

<div data-section="Details">
  <h3 data-swiftype-index="false">Details</h3>
  
  <p>An observer is like a reactive expression in that it can read reactive values
and call reactive expressions, and will automatically re-execute when those
dependencies change. But unlike reactive expressions, it doesn't yield a
result and can't be used as an input to other reactive expressions. Thus,
observers are only useful for their side effects (for example, performing
I/O).</p>

  <p>Another contrast between reactive expressions and observers is their
execution strategy. Reactive expressions use lazy evaluation; that is, when
their dependencies change, they don't re-execute right away but rather wait
until they are called by someone else. Indeed, if they are not called then
they will never re-execute. In contrast, observers use eager evaluation; as
soon as their dependencies change, they schedule themselves to re-execute.</p>

  <p>Starting with Shiny 0.10.0, observers are automatically destroyed by default
when the <a href='domains.html'>domain</a> that owns them ends (e.g. when a Shiny session
ends).</p>
