## Isolation: avoiding dependency

Sometimes it's useful for an observer/endpoint to access a reactive value or expression, but not to take a dependency on it. For example, if the observer performs a long calculation or downloads large data set, you might want it to execute only when a button is clicked. 

For this, we'll use `actionButton`. We'll define a UI that lets the user choose number of observations to generate from the normal distribution, and has an `actionButton` labeled "Go!". You can see it in action [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/gallery/actionbutton-demo.html).

The actionButton includes some JavaScript code that sends numbers to the server. When the web browser first connects, it sends a value of 0, and on each click, it sends an incremented value: 1, 2, 3, and so on.

{% highlight r %}
ui <- pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel("Click the button"),
  sidebarPanel(
    sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
                min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500),
    actionButton("goButton", "Go!")
  ),
  mainPanel(
    plotOutput("distPlot")
  )
)
{% endhighlight %}

In our `server` function, there are two items to note. First, `output$distPlot` will take a dependency on `input$goButton`, simply by accessing it. When the button is clicked, the value of `input$goButton` increases, and so `output$distPlot` re-executes.

The second is that the access to `input$obs` is wrapped with `isolate()`. This function takes an R expression, and it tells Shiny that the calling observer or reactive expression should not take a dependency on any reactive objects inside the expression.

{% highlight r %}
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    
    # Take a dependency on input$goButton
    input$goButton

    # Use isolate() to avoid dependency on input$obs
    dist <- isolate(rnorm(input$obs))
    hist(dist)
  })
}
{% endhighlight %}


The resulting graph looks like this:

![Isolated reactive value](../../images/reactivity_diagrams/isolate.png)


And here's a walkthrough of the process when `input$obs` is set to 1000, and then the Go button is clicked:

In the `actionButton` example, you might want to prevent it from returning a plot the first time, before the button has been clicked. Since the starting value of an `actionButton` is zero, this can be accomplished with the following:

{% highlight r %}
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    if (input$goButton == 0)
      return()

    # plot-making code here
  })
{% endhighlight %}


Reactive values are not the only things that can be isolated; reactive expressions can also be put inside an `isolate()`. Building off the Fibonacci example from above, this would calculate the _n_th value only when the button is clicked:

{% highlight r %}
output$nthValue <- renderText({
  if (input$goButton == 0)
    return()

  isolate({ fib(as.numeric(input$n)) })
})
{% endhighlight %}



It's also possible to put multiple lines of code in `isolate()`. For example here are some blocks of code that have equivalent effect:

{% highlight r %}
# Separate calls to isolate -------------------------------
x <- isolate({ input$xSlider }) + 100
y <- isolate({ input$ySlider })  * 2
z <- x/y

# Single call to isolate ----------------------------------
isolate({
  x <- input$xSlider + 100
  y <- input$ySlider * 2
  z <- x/y
})

# Single call to isolate, use return value ----------------
z <- isolate({
  x <- input$xSlider + 100
  y <- input$ySlider * 2
  x/y
})
{% endhighlight %}

In all of these cases, the calling function won't take a reactive dependency on either of the `input` variables.
