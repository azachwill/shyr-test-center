The `profvis` package provides tools for helping you to understand how R spends its time. It provides a interactive graphical interface for visualizing data from `Rprof`, R’s built-in tool for collecting profiling data.

The [profvis homepage](https://r-lib.github.io/profvis/) provides an extensive instructions for working with this package, as well as [an example on specifically profiling a Shiny app](https://r-lib.github.io/profvis/examples.html#example-3---profiling-a-shiny-application).
