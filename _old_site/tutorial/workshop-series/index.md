            <h3>Reactivity, Pt. 1</h3>
            <p>Reactive programming is at the heart of the Shiny framework, and thinking reactively is one of the most difficult yet most rewarding aspects of learning Shiny. This tutorial will go beyond the basics, explaining the philosophy behind Shiny's reactive programming framework and exploring patterns and techniques for using it well.</p>

            <h3>Interactive Graphics with Shiny</h3>
            <p>Creating Shiny apps with interactive graphics doesn't require learning a new plotting package. You can use your existing knowledge of R's base graphics and ggplot2 to create graphs that you and others can interact with to gain new insights about your data.</p>

            <h3>How to use Shiny Modules</h3>
            <p>As Shiny applications grow larger and more complicated, app authors frequently ask us for techniques, patterns, and recommendations for managing the growing complexity of Shiny application code. A Shiny module is a piece of a Shiny app. It can’t be directly run, as a Shiny app can. Instead, it is included as part of a larger app (or as part of a larger Shiny module–they are composable).</p>

            <h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges when building Shiny apps is figuring out what’s wrong when your app misbehaves. Fortunately, R as a language and platform is exceptionally well suited to helping us deal with this challenge, and we’ve built on those strengths with RStudio. This talk will explore some of the debugging features of R and RStudio, as well as some under-documented debugging features of Shiny itself.</p>
