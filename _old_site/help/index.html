  <h1>Getting help</h1>

  <p>Many of your questions might be answered in our <a href="/tutorial">tutorials</a> or <a href="/articles">articles</a>. If you don't find the answers you're looking for here, we have a number of other resources to recommend.</p>

  <h3>Shiny</h3>

    <p>The first place to look for help with Shiny is <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/c/shiny">RStudio Community</a>, which is a warm and welcoming place to ask any questions you might have about Shiny (as well as tidyverse and all things RStudio). The web site is running Discourse, which is an excellent community discussion platform. Our developers monitor RStudio Community answer questions periodically.</p>

    <p>You can also check the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/shiny">"shiny" tag on Stack Overflow</a> for existing answers, or post your own question. Note that questions posted on Stack Overflow are not closely monitored by our developers.</p>

  <h3>shinyapps.io</h3>

    <p>For questions about <a href="http://shinyapps.io">shinyapps.io</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect">rsconnect package</a>, check the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shinyapps-users">shinyapps-users</a> Google group.</p>
