  <h4>What About <a href="https://docs.posit.co/other/ssp/">Shiny Server Pro</a>?</h4>
  <p>For several years, Shiny Server Pro has enabled data science teams to securely share their Shiny applications on a commercially supported platform. However, in response to customer demand to be able to share many other forms of R- and Python-based content (in addition to Shiny applications), a few years ago we introduced a new product: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/">Posit Connect</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/">Posit Connect</a> is a publishing platform for all the work your teams create in R and Python. It enables you to share Shiny applications, R Markdown reports, dashboards, plots, APIs, and more in one convenient place. It provides push-button publishing from the RStudio IDE, scheduled execution of reports, and flexible security policies to bring the power of data science to your entire enterprise.</p>
  <p>Reflecting the maturity of Posit Connect as a product, and in order to focus our engineering efforts on providing the best experience for our customers in deploying all forms of R and Python data products, we are discontinuing sales of Shiny Server Pro to new customers. We will continue to support Shiny Server Pro for existing customers, but we strongly recommend customers considerÂ <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/">Posit Connect</a>.</p>
