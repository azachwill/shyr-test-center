DSAIRM is an R package that teach within-host infection dynamics and immune response modeling from a dynamical system perspective. You can explore a variety of simulation models through a graphical user interface, implemented in Shiny. By going through the documentation and instructions of each app, you will learn how models can be used to study within-host and immune response modeling. You can also access and modify all simulations to adapt them to our research needs.
