In December 2019, cases of severe respiratory illness began to be reported across the city of Wuhan in China. These were caused by a new type of coronavirus, and the disease is now commonly referred to as COVID-19. The number of COVID-19 cases started to escalate more quickly in mid-January and the virus soon spread beyond China's borders. This story has been rapidly evolving ever since, and each day we are faced by worrying headlines regarding the current state of the outbreak.

In isolation, these headlines can be hard to interpret. How fast is the virus spreading? Are efforts to control the disease working? How does the situation compare with previous epidemics? This site is updated daily based on data published by Johns Hopkins University. By looking beyond the headlines, we hope it is possible to get a deeper understanding of this unfolding pandemic.

An article discussing this app was published in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-outbreak-a-new-mapping-tool-that-lets-you-scroll-through-timeline-131422). The map was also featured on the BBC World Service program [Science in Action](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csym33).

This app is updated once daily. For more regular updates, see the [JHU COVID-19 dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).
