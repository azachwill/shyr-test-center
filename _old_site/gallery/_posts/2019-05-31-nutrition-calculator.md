Nutrient Calculator is built as a shiny dashboard where users can easily search and add multiple ingredients from the CNF database, calculate overall nutrient data such as calories and sodium, and see nutrient amounts as percentage recommended daily values. Total calorie count, nutrients amounts which surpass 100% and 50% daily value are highlighted in at the top. Macronutrients, minerals and vitamins as % daily value are visualized on separated bar graphs.
