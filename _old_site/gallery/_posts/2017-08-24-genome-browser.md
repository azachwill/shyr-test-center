This visualisation is based on Circos, a way of visualising whole genomes. Here we are using data taken from the ICGC, specifically pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumour samples from various donors. The Circos-style plot shows a number of layers, starting from the outer layer representing colour and size distinguished chromosomes, moving clockwise from chromosome 1 to 22, then X and Y. Inside the chromosomes ring, you can see a line representation of copy number mutations. When expanded (by clicking a chromosome), more details on the precise copy number at specific locations is revealed. Hover the bars for further details.
