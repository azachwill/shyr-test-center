A memory game in Shiny to find matching Hex!
  
Hex Memory Game is the winner of the Most Fun award of the 2019 Shiny Contest. A brave handful of people have built small games in Shiny. It's always impressive to us when people pull that off at all, but we haven't seen one that works as well as this one. Not only that, but the code is super clean and easy to reason about.
