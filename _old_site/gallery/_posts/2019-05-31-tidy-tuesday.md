Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project in R where users explore a new dataset each week and share their findings on Twitter with #TidyTuesday. tidytuesday.rocks collects and organizes all #TidyTuesday tweets so it's easy to see how users approached each dataset: the questions they asked, the plots they made, and the code they wrote. Use tidytuesday.rocks to learn from the friendly and talented Tidy Tuesday community and inspire your next great data visualization!
  
This app is one of the runers up of the 2019 Shiny Contest. If you haven't heard of #TidyTuesday, you're missing out on one of the most dynamic virtual events in the R community. The tidytuesday.rocks app is a tastefully minimalist interface for exploring previous weeks' datasets and community submissions for visualizations.
