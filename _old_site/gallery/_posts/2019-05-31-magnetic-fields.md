Exploring the lyrics to the three-volume album, '69 Love Songs', by The Magnetic Fields. The album was conceived and written by frontman, Stephin Merritt, but what does Stephin sing about when he sings about love (songs)? You can find out more about the app [on this blog post](https://davidsmale.netlify.com/portfolio/69-love-songs).
  
69 Love Songs is the winner of the Best Design award of the 2019 Shiny Contest. We fell in love with the look of this app, and really appreciated that the font and colours used in the app have been chosen to match the album artwork. You don't have to be a fan of the Magnetic Fields to appreciate the care and attention to detail that went into each panel!
