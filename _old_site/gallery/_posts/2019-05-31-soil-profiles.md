A Shiny App to provides the graphical representation of soil horizons, in the simplest case the color. The app offers a graphical user interface for the package soilprofile2. The focus is on morphological properties such as horizon transitions, texture, structure, root density, and rock content.  In addition, soil-forming processes such as hydromorphic soils characteristics can also be displayed.
