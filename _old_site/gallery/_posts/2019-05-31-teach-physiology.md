Explore calcium (Ca) and phosphate (Pi) homeostasis with two novel 'Shiny' apps, building upon on a previously published mathematical model written in C, 
    to ensure efficient computations. The underlying model is accessible
    at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747359.
    The first application explores the fundamentals of Ca-Pi homeostasis, 
    while the second provides interactive case studies for in-depth exploration of the topic, 
    thereby seeking to foster student engagement and an integrative understanding of Ca-Pi regulation. 
    These applications are hosted at https://rinterface.com/AppsPhysiol.html.
  
This app is one of the runers up of the 2019 Shiny Contest. If we were judging solely by ambition of vision, this submission by David Granjon would have to be our winner! The centerpiece of this app is a strikingly detailed visNetwork, but the patient simulator idea is interesting as well.
