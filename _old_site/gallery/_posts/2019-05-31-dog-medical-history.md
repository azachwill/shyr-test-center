A shiny app to keep track of and share pet records with vets. Used SQLite and AWS S3 to store data about my dogs' vaccination and medical records.
  
Pet Records s the winner of the Awwww award of the 2019 Shiny Contest. Jenna, who describes herself as a digital nomad traveling with two dogs, Layla and Lloyd, has built this app for keeping track of her dogs' medical and vaccine records. The timeline visualizations in the app are extremely effective, and the amount you can drill down ? all the way to vaccine certificates and exam notes in PDF format!
